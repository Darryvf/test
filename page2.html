        <p>At this time of my life I am getting ready to take off into a new frontier.  My plans are to work as hard as I can with the Galvanize program.  Learn everything that I can with 
           this program.  After completing the immersive program I look at getting work in the Medical side working with Patient Care Reports (PCR) programs and hopefully develop a 
           program that will be easy to use for EMS personel in the field.<p>
           
        <p>After working in this field for awhile, me and my wife have plans to start our own company.  We would like to work with small start up companies in providing
           Web sites and more for them.<p>
           
        <p>I look forward to this whirlwind of opportunity and learning.</p>
